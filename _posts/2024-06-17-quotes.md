Inspired by Paul Graham

- “You don’t need to be great to get started, you just need to get started to be great.” 千里之行，始於足下。

- “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.” Steve Jobs.

- “Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future.” Robert H Schuller

- “Define success on your own terms, achieve it by your own rules, and build a life you’re proud to live.” Anne Sweeney

- If you look at what you have in life, you always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough. This echoes 知足者常樂. Oprah Winfrey.

- The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are. Joseph Campbell

- It's all about the people

- Be the change you wish to see in the world

- You will eventually use everything you've ever learned.

- Go where you're celebrated, not tolerated

- Comparison is the thief of joy

- If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else

- We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.

- Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.
