## Thoughts

These are some notes I have shown to me every morning when I wake up, hopefully they resonate with you.

1. Treat people around you well and spend quality time with friends and family, because they will lift you up.
1. Believe in yourself, accept and love yourself and face yur imperfections. If you don't, who will?
1. Live in the present, do what makes you feel alive and live intensely. Really really want things, but chill out cause everything it going to be okay.
1. Always produce, work really hard and lead your life well. Put yourself out there and good things will happen.
1. Don't think that the world is efficient, nor perfect in its current state. There are always things to discover, problems to be solved and wrongs waited to be righted.
1. Everyone wants connection. Make small talk with people and listen to their story. Learn about people. We're all on the same boat.
1. Protect your time. Hell yeah or no.
1. Be kind to others, without being asked to, and then good things will happen
1. Adopt skepticism, be curious, think if things are true. Form a strong view of the world and hope to be contradicted by others.

## Quotes

- The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are. Joseph Campbell

- We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.

- Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.

Inspired by Paul Graham.
