## Multiview Geometry

I've been learning about Multiview Geometry recently and the thing that hasn't helped is **starting** from Hartley and Zisserman's bible on the first go ðŸ˜‰.

Some things I'd wish I had gotten a stronger grasp on the coordinate systems and the homogeneous/ inhomogeneous representations of primitives.

As has been dealt with many-a-times, the camera matrix $\textbf{P}$ is simply a mapping of the world coordinate system into the camera coordinate system.

$$\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{K}[\mathbf{R}|\mathbf{t}]$$

It first comprises of the extrinsics $[\mathbf{R} | \mathbf{t}]$, which is a rototranslation.

Additionally there are the camera intrinsics $\mathbf{K}$, which first handles the focal-length induced scaling (due to similar triangles) and then shifts the coordinate system to positive image coordinates (origin at top left corner of image).

I found that coding and visualising the objects (using something like NumPy and Open3D for visualisation) also forced me to think about the coordinate systems and was beneficial for understanding.
