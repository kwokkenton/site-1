Often you can only convince people by presenting ideas subtly, not in facts but through an anecdote, some art, or perhaps a movie. Burtynsky's photos are special not only because it melds reality into abstract art, but it raises an important conversation about nature and the world.

The exhibition showcases diamond mines. The works almost chide consumerism and the incessant thoughtless extraction of resources (rare earth metals, sapphires, diamonds, salt, marble, you name it) from
industrial processes. I also find it eerie, just having watched Dune 2, seeing these robots carve up the Earth for some mineral of choice. It's also not easy coming into contact with the fact that some regions where the manufacturing or material exploitation is happening has a history of colonialism.

As someone working in science/ engineering, and also as a general consumer, it's not easy to think about the origin of the piece of electronics, or even the branded sportsshoe I'm wearing. In this new world, when semiconductors run everything, it is important to stay connected with the origin of our prosperity and technological progress.

> You can't help but feel a sense of "cosmic insignificance" when looking at these pictures.

Burtynsky take is that for man to live some degree of land and resource extraction must occur. But how much is too much and when would we know that we're at the brink of a Malthusian catastrophe? As depressing as this seems, it is inspiring to see the work of an artist who has spent 40 years exploring this problem central to modern humanity's existence. With 3 floors of powerful exhibit items, there is no doubt this manifesto, in the guise of art, will convince, persuade and sway people.
