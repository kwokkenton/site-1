Hiya, my name is Kenton! I am an experimental imaging physicist and data scientist. Nice to meet you!


This is my website where I post about some of my previous work, projects and also some bits of research I've done on specific topics that might be useful!

# A bit about me
I graduated with an MSci in Physics from Imperial College London, UK, where my Master's project was in biophotonics i.e. applying optics to biological samples.
