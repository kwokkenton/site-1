The one thing you can always gladly bank on is that life will always give you surprises. Certainly, I did not imagine at the start of this year that I could make a little bit of money off my passion of photography — by setting up shop on one of the most famous streets in the historic city of London.

I run an instagram account going by the name of @kurnturn. On it, I regularly post some photography I have taken over the years in various places around the world. Most of my photos belong in the category of travel photography — bursts of colour, well-known landmarks, interesting streets and also idyllic villages. What I love is not only visiting these places, but also doing some further research and understanding the history and perhaps geographical background of what shaped its present.

Having been encouraged by some friends once or twice, I always had a thought about trying to sell some prints of my photos for money. Online platforms such as Etsy are oversaturated and even though I had set up an account, it wasn’t being noticed. The moment I saw a Facebook promotion by the Borough’s Facebook account one Friday about an opportunity to sell a product in person on Portobello Road Market, I knew something was on.

Despite the short notice, being 20, spontaneous and having some spare time on my hands during the summer, I immediately called up one of my friends Michael and we decided to join this programme together.

This was part of the NewYouthquake initiative to encourage young people to use local markets to display, promote and even sell their work. For as little as £10, I could have all paperwork and insurance completed and rent a stall to launch my product to locals. I am very glad that the council had this opportunity up on offer for young people.

As this was my first time trading, I had no prior experience to base my operations on so I expected to be on the back foot right at the start. My business goals are still undefined and it is destined that there will be some trouble on starting up. I had a good guess but ultimately I did not know who my audience was or what even I am trying to sell precisely. But I was up for the challenge.

Research
Audience
The intention of my instagram account was to reach people around the world who also loved travelling and learning about stories behind cities. My follower base was mostly from Hong Kong as a result from my previous content and so this means that the audience I want to reach with my stall will not have an overlap with my existing following.

I had opted to go for two main audience bases- first the locals in London who might want something to decorate their homes with and second Hong Kong diaspora in the UK who might form an emotional connection to my photos.

Products
Having set the audience, it is easier to choose what photos to sell. I shortlisted some of my best photos, those that have some special aspect to them, paying attention to a few exceptional shots taken in my hometown of Hong Kong.

Some products I planned on selling
Preparation
Products
This was the easier half of the preparation. Having no stock beforehand, I had to make some quick decisions and order in what I wanted to sell. I decided that I wanted to offer just a few products — small 6x4" prints that will be priced lower and therefore will sell in greater volumes to people on a smaller budget and larger high-quality prints for people to put up on their walls or decorate their homes with.

source prints from print shop — how to reduce cost? should I use an online supplier? what will the delivery time be?
buy frames — how many to buy, at what size?
buy packaging for my prints — acid free tissue paper and paperclips
I also had trouble trying to price my shots, having no experience of a pricing strategy whatsoever. In the end I consulted a few friends of mine and I went with some of their advice.

Stall
The other aspect of physical preparation would be the stall. Under recommendation by the Market association, I sourced a nice shiny tablecloth from my home and also created some cardboard racks to put my photos on for display. They emphasised a lot on layering and creating an attractive storefront. My friend gladly helped me with creating bunting, painting some boxes and making the stall look as cool as possible.

My understanding after living in the UK for two years is that very few people still use cash. This is why I bought a Zettle card reader, which arrived and was set up very rapidly.

Marketing
With the physical aspects of the venture sorted out, I have to figure out the marketing for the event. I created a series of 9 instagram posts featuring mockups I created on Photoshop and a product catalogue for all to see. I also typed up some paragraphs that described my work and what I was going to do on the day.

One instagram post I had put up
As part of this, I also dedicated some money to do Facebook Ads to hope to reach a greater audience.

Branding and Ideology
It is always easier to do something for your own interest and personal pleasure. Trying to monetise it is far more difficult and arduous task. I understood that I had some problems I needed to address in order to create my personal ‘brand.’

Intertwining travel, photography and culture — good headline or not?

Other than selling an object, I think to be successful you also have to sell a story. Questions like these always popped up in my head

What makes your photos special?
Who am I and how do I personally relate to these photos?
Can’t anyone go and reproduce your photos?
Since this is my personal brand and I am selling my own creations, it is very easy for questions like these to spiral into doubts in confidence about my personal ability, which can be dangerous sometimes. I think it is important to adopt a growth mindset and constantly remind myself that my photography skills, product or business at this moment is not at its final form. I tried to embrace the idea that failing is okay from the beginning. Even so, I felt some pressure coming from within for me to try my best and make profit the first time I’m running this effectively.

A story I have written behind one of my photos
The Big Day — wind and rain

My stall before setting up
Quite unfortunately, the day started off with cloud, wind and rain. I had pumped myself up with coffee and tea and prepared myself to stand for as long as I can! One of the stalls next to us that sells clothes, a middle-aged couple presumably were also kind enough to make hot tea for us during the event, which was very warming on a few levels.

The market flow was slower than I expected. A few key moments that stood out to me was when I made my first sale at about 11 am to a girl from Canada visiting some family here in London, which made me incredibly happy! Another key moment was when a few of my friends started to pop up, just to come visit my stall. Another exciting moment was when some Youtube Influencers from Hong Kong who have moved to London interviewed both me and my friend.

Short interview on Michael’s business and my work
The rain was a major setback as Mark from the council and the other stall next to us kept telling us about how the footfall would have been much higher otherwise. Anyway, I’m happy to say that I broke even on this venture, which accompanied with the enjoyable experience made my time worthwhile :)

Learning points
A few things quite unexpected occurred during this venture, the rain being one of the obvious parts. Another quite irritating thing was how my online print supplier lost part of my order and only had it delivered after my pop up shop, which meant that I had to find another shop to print my photos just one day before the event! This greatly increased my operating costs, gave me some extra stress and was another reason why I could not have made a greater profit.

Networking — how to talk with locals, making your pitch
Practical skills — making good quality prints, experiencing a print shop
Life skills — avoiding getting scammed, doing things earlier in time
Prioritising the work of my business — marketing definitely took too much time, should have focused more on the business brand and ideology
Also, my friends who have attended the day also gave me some useful advice/constructive criticism regarding photography and my business. I am very happy to have received this and am delighted to have concrete things to work on next time.

I consider myself a fortunate person to be living in London right now and to have had this opportunity to test my business idea out. Not everyone has the ability to bring their idea to market, given that every business has start-up costs and involve the risk of failing. Luckily, I survived and am proud to have been an ‘entrepreneur,’ for one short day in my life.
