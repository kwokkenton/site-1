## Hiya, my name is Kenton!

I am a computer vision engineer and physicist. Delighted to meet you!

I love science and technology (especially impact-driven and interdisciplinary work) and my goal is to make a healthier, smarter, more equitable and happier world with it. I also enjoy [communicating science](https://www.instagram.com/fizzyphys/) and the wonders it can do.

I am focused on Machine Learning for biology and will be starting a PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://cdt.sensors.cam.ac.uk/) in October 2025.

## A bit about me

I am currently a part-time Surgical Vision Engineer at [EnAcuity](https://www.enacuity.com/) and building a selection of personal projects.

Previously, I had worked for [Living Optics](/_portfolio/10_LO.md), [TTP](/_portfolio/12_TTP.md) and [ManholeMetrics](/_portfolio/11_MHM.md) and contributed to projects in computer vision, medical devices, bioinstrumentation and data pipelines.

I graduated with an MSci in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked within the [biophotonics group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/photonics/research/biophotonics/) and developed a [computational imaging microscope](/_portfolio/00_MSci-project.md) for biology. I was also chair of the [Imperial Data Science Society](https://imperialdatasoc.co.uk/) organising hackathons and delivering ML lectures.

My CV is also available for a summary of my skills and experiences. Please have a look at my [scientific communications page](https://www.instagram.com/fizzyphys/), my [technical work](/portfolio/) and my [photography](/photography.md) too!
