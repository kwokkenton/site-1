Hiya, my name is Kenton! I am an experimental imaging physicist and data scientist. Nice to meet you!


This is my website where I post about some of my previous work, projects and also some bits of research I've done on specific topics that might be useful!

# A bit about me
I graduated with an MSci in Physics from Imperial College London. My academic interests are in all flavours of biophotonics, computational imaging and machine learning.

My CV is also available for a summary of my skills and experiences.
