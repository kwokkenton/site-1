Hiya, my name is Kenton! I am sometimes a [computer vision engineer](/_portfolio/01_LIM.md), sometimes an [imaging physicist](/_portfolio/12_TTP.md) and sometimes a [data scientist](/_portfolio/03_data-science.md). This is my small corner of the internet. Nice to meet you!

# A bit about me

I am currently working at [Living Optics](https://www.livingoptics.com/), a UK based startup aiming to democratise hyperspectral imaging. My main work is interfacing with customers and prototyping algorithms to their needs and doing applications research.

Previously, I graduated with an MSci in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked within the [biophotonics group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/photonics/research/biophotonics/) and developed a [computational imaging microscope](/_portfolio/00_MSci-project.md) that allowed you to visualise nearly-transparent tissues in 3D. I was also part of the [Imperial Data Science Society](https://imperialdatasoc.co.uk/) organising hackathons and delivering ML lectures.

I love science and technology (especially interdisciplinary work) and my goal is to make a healthier, smarter, more equitable and happier world with it.

My CV is also available for a summary of my skills and experiences. Please have a look at my [technical work](/portfolio/) and my [photography](/photography.md) too!
