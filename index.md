Hiya, my name is Kenton! I am a computer vision engineer and imaging physicist. This is my small corner of the internet. Nice to meet you!

I love science and technology (especially impact-driven and interdisciplinary work) and my goal is to make a healthier, smarter, more equitable and happier world with it. I also enjoy communicating science and the wonders it can do. Currently, I am focusing on Machine Learning for biology.

# A bit about me

I am currently working at [Living Optics](/_portfolio/10_LO.md), a UK based startup aiming to democratise hyperspectral imaging. My main work is interfacing with customers and prototyping algorithms to their needs and doing applications research.

I also worked at [TTP](/_portfolio/12_TTP.md), as a physicist who contributed to medical devices and bioinstrumentation, and [ManholeMetrics](/_portfolio/11_MHM.md) as a data scientist who built weather data pipelines.

I graduated with an MSci in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked within the [biophotonics group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/photonics/research/biophotonics/) and developed a [computational imaging microscope](/_portfolio/00_MSci-project.md) that allowed you to visualise nearly-transparent tissues in 3D. I was also part of the [Imperial Data Science Society](https://imperialdatasoc.co.uk/) organising hackathons and delivering ML lectures.

My CV is also available for a summary of my skills and experiences. Please have a look at my [scientific communications page](https://www.instagram.com/fizzyphys/), my [technical work](/portfolio/) and my [photography](/photography.md) too!
