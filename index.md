Hiya, my name is Kenton Kwok! I am an experimental imaging physicist and data scientist and this is my small corner of the internet. Nice to meet you!

This is my website where I post about some of my previous work, projects and also some bits of research I've done on specific topics that might be useful!

# A bit about me

I am currently working at [Living Optics](https://www.livingoptics.com/), a UK based startup aiming to democratise hyperspectral imaging. As an Applications Engineer, I am a customer-facing developer/ scientist who aims to write code and help

Previously, I graduated with an MSci in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked within the biophotonics group and developed a microscope that allowed you to visualise nearly-transparent tissues in 3D.

My goal is to make a healthier, smarter, more equitable and happier world using technology.

My CV is also available for a summary of my skills and experiences.
