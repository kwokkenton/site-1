![Salsa](/files/salsa/phone.png)

I made a web/ mobile application for keeping track of Salsa practices, as I found it quite difficult just using the photos app on the phone. This was also a good opportunity for me to learn some web/ mobile development.

Flutter uses Dart, a language that isn't so similar to Python which I had to learn. Firebase on the other hand is known as a 'Backend as a Service,' which has a generous free tier and shortens development time significantly.

## Skills developed

**Programming**: Firebase, Flutter
