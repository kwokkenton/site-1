Some resources others may find useful!

## For the programmer

Check out my [post](/_posts/2025-08-28-missing-semester.md) on common tips for programming like a pro that they don't teach you in university, such as environments, organisation and collaboration.

## For the student

I'd recommend studying anything that **truly interests you**. The payoffs may not be as apparent immediately but there will be an enduring warm, mellow and sweet aftertaste that comes from within.

### For the undergraduate: Applying for research experiences

I would highly recommend students to seek diverse experiences, whether it be in research, industry, or something started by yourself :)

- Institute of Cancer Research Undergraduate [Summer Scholarship Scheme](https://www.icr.ac.uk/studying-and-training/undergraduate-summer-scholarship-scheme)
- Francis Crick institute [Summer Student Training program](https://www.crick.ac.uk/careers-study/students/summer-students)
- Cancer Research UK [Summer Research Programme](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/students/undergraduate-summer-research-programme/)
- EPFL [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/), [Quantitative biology](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/education/summer-research-program/)
- Germany DaaD [RISE](https://www.daad.org.uk/en/find-funding/undergraduate-funding-opportunities/research-internships-in-science-and-engineering-rise/)
- Imperial College London [UROP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/what-is-urop/)

I'd also encourage students to seek out **good and encouraging mentors**, perhaps 1-2 steps ahead of you for relevant and relatable advice.

### Secondary school: Applying for university

The UCAS application has changed to 3 questions

1. Why do you want to study this course or subject?
2. How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?
3. What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?

I'd recommend reading, watching videos, doing mini projects, joining competitions and extracurriculars so your application stands out and you make sure that it it really what you want to put time into! The goal in your application is to show understanding of what studying the course is like through giving examples. A true understanding can only achieved by **doing it** so make sure to go beyond reading and try synthesising information/ working on a project. This is what the IB Extended Essay and Internal Assessments encourage you to do. You also want to develop a special interest in select **parts** of the subject and justify that this degree will help you gain the skills for that.

For my application, I also mentioned experiences of participating/ winning local STEM competitions, joining summer schools at local universities and the extended school projects that I did. These are some of my favourite books in the sciences and I've included some of them in my personal statement, especially in the start to demonstrate where your interest originated from.

- In search of Schr√∂dinger's cat -- John Gribbin
- Alex's Adventures in in Numberland-- Alex Bellos
- The Code Breaker-- Walter Issacson
- The Power of Habit-- Charles Duhigg
- Why we sleep? -- Matthew Walker

## For the curious mind

For the 16 year old me

- [What you'll wish you'd known](https://paulgraham.com/hs.html) - Paul Graham: essay on school and where to use your energy (from an American perspective)
- [How to do what you love](https://paulgraham.com/love.html)- Paul Graham: essay on adults, careers, love, fun and work.

For the 20 year old me

- [Randy Pausch Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&t=2s)-- Don't lose the child-like wonder. Follow your dreams but you may find that enabling dreams of others may be more fun! Remember to help and show gratitude to people. The brick walls you run into are for separating those who really want something and those who do not.

- [Graham Weaver Last Lecture]()-- what would you do if you couldn't fail? Follow your energy and go all into that.
